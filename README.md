My Intermediate_Arduino assignments

Hello LCD was an assignment created to make an LCD print "Hello World". In this assignment I learned how to wire an LCD and I began to learn how to code one. This assignment was a bit challenging for me, but I feel like I got a lot out of it. Next time I would get more help on the assignment sooner, so that I am able to complete the assignments faster.
LCD Backpack was an assignment that made an LCD screen light up and say "button presses= (however many times the button has been pressed)".
